Assembly Language   Programming Assignment 2

Date Assigned:  Friday, Nov. 1, 2013
Date Due:       Friday, Nov. 22, 2013

Instructions:  Demonstrate each program to your lab TA. Print
               out your .lis file and have it signed by your lab TA.
               Submit your executable program and your .asm file using
               EAS. Submit your signed .list file in class (lecture time)



Write the following INTEL 80x86 assembly language programs


1. Write a subroutine which determines the larger of two unsigned
   numbers.  The two arguments are to be passed to the subroutine
   via the CPU registers AL and BL.  The return value is to be placed
   into CPU register DL.

   Write a main program which declares two lists of numbers:

section .data

num1 db 1,2,3,4
num2 db 5,1,7,2


The main program uses a loop to read each pair of numbers and
passes the two numbers as arguments to the subroutine. The 
main program is to call the subroutine and then store the 
maximum value in main memory at location max defined by the
assembler directive:

section .bss

; put UNINITIALIZED data here using

ans resb 4  




Single step your program and examine memory contents as necessary to
verify your programs work correctly. Observe the value of IP as the
subroutine is called and returned from.

2. Repeat part 1 above using the stack (instead of CPU registers)
   to pass the two parameters to the subroutine.  Use the EBP register
   to access the parameters from the stack.
