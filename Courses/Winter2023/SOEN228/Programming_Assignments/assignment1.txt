Assembly Language  Programming Assignment 1
Date Assigned:  Tuesday, March 29, 2016
Date Due:       Tuesday, April 12, 2016 


Instructions:  Demonstrate each program to your lab TA. Print
               out your .lis file and have it signed by your lab TA.
               Submit your executable program and your .asm file using
               EAS.


Write the following INTEL 8088 assembly language programs

1. compare four 16-bit integers which represent signed numbers in
   two's complement notation. The integers are named MICK, KEITH, CHARLIE,
   and RON. Store the largest value in the AX register and the smallest
   value in the DX register. Test your program with the following data:


MICK 	dw 30000
KEITH 	dw 0ABCDH
CHARLIE dw 7FFFH
RON 	dw 1000100010001000B


2. Repeat the above this time assuming that the 16-bit integers represent
   UNSIGNED binary numbers.


3. Given an array of 10 8-bit integers, count and add up all the positive,
   even numbers. Store the sum in the AX register and the count in the
   CX register. Test your program with your own data values.




Single step your program and examine memory contents as necessary to
verify your programs work correctly.
